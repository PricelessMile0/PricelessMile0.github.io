			I am currently only doing one piece of coursework, which is for Computer Science, but I am also doing an EPQ.
			<br>For computer science, I am currently creating a simple game. My game is a 2D platform with multiple levels, 
			where the player must navigate the level through treacherous enemies and hard logic puzzles, as well as completing
			a side quest to earn extra points.
			<br>For my EPQ, I am researching which characteristics of warfare greatly contributed to the best infantry of the gunpowder era.
			My interest in this subject comes from playing games throughout my childhood, such as Battle Realms, Sid Meier's Civilization and Europa Universalis IV.

			My main inspiration for my EPQ was learning about the Polish Winged Hussars. Theses are one of my greatest
			interests and are considered by many as <br>'The Greatest Cavalry in History'.
